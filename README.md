# dart_ffi_example

This project is an example for my [Medium](https://medium.com/@bugra.ahmetozcan/interop-native-c-and-c-in-dart-code-with-dart-ffi-e0e34a6a3156) article and it show how can you use dart:ffi.

>Dart mobile, command-line, and server apps running on the Dart Native platform can use the dart:ffi library to call native C APIs, and to >read, write, allocate, and deallocate native memory. FFI stands for foreign function interface. Other terms for similar functionality >include native interface and language bindings.
